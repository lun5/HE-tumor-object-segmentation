function [xCW,yCW]=sortPoint2ContourCW(x,y)
%% function [xCW,yCW]=sortPoint2ContourCW(x,y)
% Sorts arbitrary points into a Clock Wise direction contour.
%
%% Syntax
% [xCW,yCW]=sortPoint2ContourCW(x,y)
%
%% Description
% This functions goal is to order points in a clockwise order efficintly. While this
% problem can be hard to solve, and even sometimes considered unsolvable, it is solved
% here basing on the assumption that "nearest point in Clock Wise direction" is the point
% found after sorting by X values, and finding nearest point in Y. This results in a
% solution of O(N^2) complexity, but im most cases it will be of significantly lower
% complexity.
%
%% Input arguments:
% x- x coordinates of the points 
%
% y- x coordinates of the points 
%
%% Output arguments
% xCW- sorted points (so a CW contour will be created) x coordinates. 
%
% yCW- sorted points (so a CW contour will be created) y coordinates. 
%
%% Issues & Comments (None)
% The resulting shape will have points connected,accordung to a predfined metric, so it
% will not always result in a shape user wished for. Add additonal points to fix this
% issue, when needed.
% To avoid "saw toothe coming from neighbouring poinst, comment out the while loop lines
% 77-86. This will also improve run time, but will be less accurate.

%% Example
% N=11;
% x=10*rand(1,N);
% y=10*rand(1,N);
% [xCW,yCW]=sortPoint2ContourCW(x,y);
% figure;
% plot(x,y,'.-b');
% hold on;
% plot(xCW,yCW,'.-r','LineWidth',2);
