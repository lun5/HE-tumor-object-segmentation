This is the root directory for iseToolbox and utvisToolbox.  

There are tutorials in:
   utvisTuoolbox/tutorials/
   iseToolbox/tutorials/

To run these tutorials you need to set your
matlab path to include the directories in these
toolboxes.  A simple way to do that is, from within
the matlab console:
  cd ~jepson/pub/matlab
  clear startup
  which startup % It should refer to the one in the current directory
  startup
  
  % Then you can run the tutorials by opening, say,
  % utvisToolbox/tutorials/colourTutorial.m in an editor
  % and pasting the commands into the matlab console.

  % A simple way to check if this is going to work is to
  % type:
  which colourTutorial  
  % It should refer to the one in utvisToolbox
  colourTutorial  % Execute the whole script.
If you wish to return to another job in matlab,
then (within Matlab) cd to your own matlab directory and type:
  clear startup
  startup
To reset your path.
