Browse mixScript.m.  It contains the Matlab code for driving the model
selection tutorial.  Cut and paste this code into your Matlab window.

You should also open and browse the M-file modelSelection.m when it is
called from mixScript.m

For a demonstration of the use of 1D mixture models, see the script file:
   ./touristRemoval/fitBackground.m
