Run the matlab script file motionTutorial.m

But first, make sure:

  - the Matlab toolboxes iseToolbox, utvisToolbox are on your matlab path
    (see course homepage for these toolboxes).

  - the image sequences
       fleetface1/frameDec*.pgm 
       dudekface1/frameDec*.pgm 
    (i.e. 320 x 240 monochrome images) are available.  On CSLab and CDF
    machines these directories are in ~jepson/pub/matlab/images/seq/
