This directory contains three matlab script files
  oTensorDemo.m    - 2D Orientation Tensor
  houghDemo.m      - Hough transform for image lines
  robustDemo.m     - Partial robust M-estimation applied to image lines.
                     Shows local convergence of iteratively reweighted
                     least squares.
  robustLineScript.m  - Runs a robust line estimator based on the objective
                        function in robustDemo.m, with additional controls
                        for leverage points.
